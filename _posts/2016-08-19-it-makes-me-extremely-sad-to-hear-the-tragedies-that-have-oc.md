  It makes me extremely sad to hear the tragedies that have occurred in the last
  few months. Or to even hear the absurdities of this years Presidential
  campaign. Perhaps we have all forgotten that each and everyone of us are made
  of the same cosmic materials that created our universe. I normally stay away
  from political conversations but I found myself losing sleep over all of this.
  Taking a life does not prove anything and only continues the vicious cycle.
  Why are we all so preoccupied with everyone else? The prejudices we all see
  are the reminisce of a past where we did not have the knowledge we have today.
  Why are we so committed to destroying ourselves, our homes and the families of
  others? This road can only lead us to our demise.

It makes me extremely sad to hear the tragedies that have occurred in the last few months. Or to even hear the absurdities of this years Presidential campaign. Perhaps we have all forgotten that each and everyone of us are made of the same cosmic materials that created our universe. I normally stay away from political conversations but I found myself losing sleep over all of this. Taking a life does not prove anything and only continues the vicious cycle.

Don't we see that together we could accomplish much more? That in our ignorance we stifle ourselves. Why settle for a fraction of the universe when there is so much more. And that brings me to one of my favorite Carl Sagan quotes.

> _The earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corners, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds._
> 
> _Our posturing, our imagined self importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, challenged by this point of pale light._
> 
> _..._
> 
> _To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, to preserver and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever know._

> * Carl Sagan, Pale Blue Dot

Maybe its time we take a look at the bigger picture and realize that our arrogance will leave us stranded and much sooner than we think, homeless. While some have been mistreated more than others over the last few hundred years, its important to start thinking of ourselves as one race. Doesn't anyone remember, "United we stand. Divided we fall." All matter matters. Be kind to one another, and cherish what we have. The person next to you may be the next Einstein, or Marie Curie. Or maybe they are the ones who inspire our next geniuses. And you, you should remember that you influence people everyday in both positive and negative ways.

Next time you look up at the night sky, think about how vast and seemly endless it is. Think of your size in relation to the things around us. Because if I put you next to a planet like Jupiter, I wouldn't even notice you there.

> _**We're Johnny-come-lately's, we live in the cosmic boondocks, we emerged from microbes and muck. Apes are our cousins, our thoughts and our feelings are not fully under our control. And on to top of all this, we're making a mess of our planet and becoming a danger to ourselves.**_
